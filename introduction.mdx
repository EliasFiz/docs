## Why Canopy
Canopy allows you to build audio-visual AI (AI that speaks and has a face) that can engage in real time fully customisable 
conversations with your users. 
<p> 
Moreover, Canopy is a <b> fully flexible </b> SDK. You can build bots which take actions in real time, like:
- An ecommerce website AI consultant that can purchase clothes while guiding a customer through the eStore.
- An AI interviewer which can execute applicants code during a software engineering video interview and steer the conversation depending on how it runs.
-  A beauty Consultant  which can search for products from a database as the customer describes their preferences. 
-  A Zoom bot that sits on calls and pitches in when necessary
