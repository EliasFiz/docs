- A voice bot which can call RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and dynamically help users about the information it retrieves
- An AI interviewer which can execute applicants code during a software engineering video interview and steer the conversation depending on how it runs
-  A beauty Consultant  which can search for products from a database as the customer describes their preferences.
