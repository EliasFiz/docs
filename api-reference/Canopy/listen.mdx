title: 'canopy.listen'

<RequestExample>

```javascript index.js
document.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
  canopy.listen()
})
```

</RequestExample>
This is to start the listener - which will now stream the user's audio to the server. 

<Warning>Most browsers have a security feature that requires the user interact with the page before it can start listening for audio. 
This means the `canopy.listen` method must be called in response to a browser event. </Warning>
