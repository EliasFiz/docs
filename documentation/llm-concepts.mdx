## Overview
Conversations consist of a `messageThread` which contains `dialogues`. They each have a `role` and `content` property.:

| Term | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Message Thread    | A list/array of objects that comprise the conversation; each object is a dialogue  |
| Conversation    | Same as message thread  |
| Dialogue      |  Each object is a Dialogue that has a role and a content property                  |
| Role      |  Will be one of `user`, `assistant`, or `system`.              |
| Content      |  A String representation of the conversation           |
| Agent      |  A Canopy bot that can take actions         |



### Models

We current support the following models:
| Model | Overview                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `gpt-3.5-turbo`     | Ultra low latency, not good for action calling or applications which require complex logic                   |
| `gpt-4-turbo`     | ~ +300 ms of latency. Good for agent like behaviour and action calling                          |
## CRUD  conversations
You can run the CRUD operations: 
| Operation ID | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `ReadConversation`     | Sends the `messageThread` to the client  |
| `AppendDialogue`     | Adds a `dialogue` to the `messageThread`|
| `UpdateDialogue`     | Updates a `dialogue` in the `messageThread`|
| `DeleteDialogue`     | Deletes a `dialogue` in the `messageThread`|
### Read Conversation ###
<p> You can submit the `ReadConversation` event which will return the entire `messageThread`.</p>

```javascript
const canopy  = new Canopy ({ ... }) 
const { messageThread }  = await canopy.ReadConversation()
```
The response will be something like:
```javascript
{
    success: true,
    timestamp: 1623346800,
    messageThread: [
         {
            role: "system",
            content: "You are a friendly bot"
        },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Hello"
        },
        {
            role: "assistant",
            content: "Hi there!"
        }
        ...
    ]
}
```
You can use `ReadConversation` to get the entire message thread, and parse and do what you want with it.

### Append Dialogue ###
<p> You can submit the `AppendDialogue` event which will, add the dialogue you provide to the end of the `messageThread`, and return the entire `messageThread`.</p>

```javascript
const canopy  = new Canopy ({ ... }) 
const { messageThread }  = await canopy.AppendDialogue({
    role: "system",
    content: "Here is information from the database:..."
})
```
The response will be the message thread with the appended dialogue.
You can use `AppendDialogue` to add a message to the conversation. For example,if you were retrieving data from a database you could pass it as information in a system message. 
If you were 


### Update Dialogue ###
<p> You can submit the `UpdateDialogue` event which will return the entire message thread.</p>

```javascript
const canopy  = new Canopy ({ ... }) 
const { messageThread }  = await canopy.UpdateDialogue({
    role: "system",
    content: "Here is information from the database:...", 
    dialogueIndex:4 // the index in the message thread array of this dialogue
})
```
The response will be the message thread with the appended dialogue.
You can use `UpdateDialogue` to change a message in the conversation. For example, if you wanted to fill in information about the user in a system message as you learn it.

### Delete Dialogue ###
<p> You can submit the `DeleteDialogue` event which will return the entire message thread.</p>

```javascript
const canopy  = new Canopy ({ ... }) 
const { messageThread }  = await canopy.DeleteDialogue({
    dialogueIndex:4 // the index in the message thread array of this dialogue
})
```
The response will be the message thread with the appended dialogue.
