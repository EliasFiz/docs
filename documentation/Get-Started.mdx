The following is just a simple example of how to start with Canopy. For a full guide see the <a href="/api-reference"> API reference </a>

## Step 1: Install Canopy
<p>
We recommend you use our JS SDK or React Hook to abstract away the complexity of our API. Assuming you are using our JS SDK, 
first we link to the CDN by pasting the following into th head of your HTML file. 
</p>

```html
<head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.canopyai.xyz/@0.0.1"></script>
    ...
</head>
```

## Step 2: Authenticate
<p>
Since you connect to the Canopy web socket on the frontend, you need to generate an `authToken` (i.e. a JWT) to pass to Canopy. You should do
this on a server for security reasons.
</p>
<p>
You need to pass your `apiToken` to the `/get-auth-token` endpoint. Please get an `apiToken` from the <a href="https://canopylabs.co/dashboard"> Dashboard </a>
</p>

```cURL 
curl -X GET "https://api.canopyai.xyz/get-auth-token?api_token=<apiToken>"
```

You will get a JSON object back, where the `expiresAt` is the latest timestamp you can use it.

```json
{
    "success":true, 
    "authToken":"d32ed31odDGyH9da", 
    "expiresAt":161823219827
}
```

## Step 3: Connect

Back on the frontend let's connect to Canopy. We start by creating a `CanopyConfig` and passing it to the Canopy Constructor. 

```javascript
//run the logic to retrieve your auth token as defined above

const Canopy = {
    initialSystemMessage:"You are a funny bot.", 
    authToken
}
const canopy  = new Canopy(Canopy)

//include the two lines below for a moving avatar
//******
const canvasElement = document.getElementById("canvasElement")
canopy.visualise(canvasElement); 
//******

const { success } = await Canopy.connect()

console.log(success) // true
```
