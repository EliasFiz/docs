## Speech Concepts

The way your character sounds influences the style of your application. We integrate with a range of TTS engines.


### Voice
Simply, we support Open Voices. All of these <b> `voice_ids`</b> are optimised for speed (so not `-hd` models). 

<p> 
- Alloy
- Echo
- Fable
- Onyx
- Nova
- Shimmer
</p>
<p> To listen to samples just go to the Open AI website and select the voice you want to hear</p>

<p> If you want to use an Eleven Labs voice, please email us with your request and we'll give you access within 24 hrs. 
All that changes is that you have to specify an Eleven Labs Voice Id instead. </p>

### Playback Speed
This parameter controls the speed of the audio playback. You can convey different personalities by changing the speed of the audio.
Generally we recommend setting the speed <b> between 0.9 and 1.1. </b>
