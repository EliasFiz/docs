## Receiving Actions

Remember that Canopy parses the LLM output and POSTs to the `baseAgentUrl` the following
format. 
Make sure that you have passed the `baseAgentUrl` and `initialSystemMessage` in the CanopyConfig object, from the frontend,
<a href="/documentation/action-taking-agents/guide#step-1-initiate-actions-with-a-system-message"> like here: </a>

```json
//POST request
{
    "actionType":"UPGRADE", 
    "actionData":{
        "email":"hi@canopyai.xyz", 
        "tier":"premium"
    }
}
```
Now let's set up code to listen for these actions and respond accordingly. We are going to continue using the example
from the <a href="/documentation/action-taking-agents/system-message"> previous section </a>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Required Packages">
  <CodeGroup>

```bash npm
#We can use express to host our server
npm install express
```
```bash pip
#We can use flask to host our server
pip install flask
```


</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Starting Listening For Post Requests">
  Now let's set up our server to listen for actions - here are a couple of examples in different languages.
    <CodeGroup>
```javascript index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
app.use(express.json());

async function handleAction(actionType, actionData) {
    //we will make this function in the next step
    console.log("handling action", actionType, actionData);

    //sending back some placeholder data
    return {actionResponseType: "SUCCESS", actionResponseData: {}};
}

app.post('/', async (req, res) => {

    const { actionType, actionData } = req.body;
    const {actionResponseType, actionResponseData} = await handleAction(actionType, actionData);

    //You do not need to send actions back to the LLM
    //But you can for more interactive experiences
    res.send(JSON.stringify({actionResponseType, actionResponseData}));
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
```python index.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

async def handleAction(actionType, actionData):
    # We will make this function in the next step
    print("Handling action", actionType, actionData)
    # Placeholder for your action handling logic (next step)
    return "responseType", "responseData"

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
async def index():
    data = request.get_json()
    actionType = data['actionType']
    actionData = data['actionData']

    actionResponseType, actionResponseData = await handleAction(actionType, actionData)

    # You do not need to send actions back to the LLM
    # But you can for more interactive experiences
    return jsonify({'actionResponseType': actionResponseType, 'actionResponseData': actionResponseData})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=3000, debug=True)
```
</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Writing the handleAction function">
    We will now handle the action that we received from the LLM. 
    We will just use a dummy response, but you should use this function to do what you want.

    <p> If its unclear what the `actionType` and `actionData` are, please refer to the <a href="/documentation/action-taking-agents/guide#step-2-respond-to-actions-optional"> previous section </a> </p>

```javascript index.js

    //lets write a switch statement to handle the different action types

    switch (actionType) {

            //write code to unsubscribe the user from database
