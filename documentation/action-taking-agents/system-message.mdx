This is a 2-Part tutorial. The first part is a quick guide to writing a good system message to teach your agent its instructions. 
The second part is how to set up your server, to deal with these actions and send the necessary data back. 
In this tutorial, we will be using the example of a clothing store, where users can search for items of clothing, subscribe to a newsletter, 
cancel their subscription, and purchase clothes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify all POST Endpoints">
    First you need to figure out all the `POST` endpoints that are used by the agent. We recommend you use up to 10, but the fewer the better. 
    We also recommend you dynamically add `system dialogues` using the `AppendDialogue` endpoint depending on how the conversation is going. 

    Let's say I have the following endpoints:
    | Action | Required JSON |
| -------- | -------------------------------------
| `UNSUBSCRIBE`     |  `{"uid":"<6 digit string>", "reason":"<string> for why the user wants to unsubscribe"}`  |
| `QUERY`     |  `{"reason":"<string> query string for clothing item you want to search for (i.e. small woolen red jumper)"}`  |
| `SUBSCRIBE`     |`{"uid":"<6 digit code>", "subscription":"<string> 'weekly' or 'monthly'"}` |
| `PURCHASE`     | `{"uid":"<6 digit code>", "itemId":"<string 6 digits starting>", "color":"<string> 'blue' or 'black', 'red', 'green', 'auburn'"}` |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Construct as Follows">
Now create a system message of the following structure:

### Introduce the Concept
First tell outline to the bot what it is supposed to do. 

```javascript
`You are a bot designed to assist users in managing their interactions with our clothing store.
You can take specific actions when necessary, using the following format:
<ACTIONNAME>
    {
        "required data as JSON"
    }
</ACTIONNAME>
You have the capability to perform the following actions:`
```
### List the Actions
Then list the actions that the bot can take, and the required JSON for each action. Here is the
format we recommend:


```javascript
`ACTIONNAME (short string about point of action).

Call ACTIONNAME like this:
<ACTIONNAME>
    {
        "required data as JSON String"
    }
</ACTIONNAME>
(short string about point of action)`
```

### Putting This Together
If we put this together, we get the following system message, for our clothing store:


```javascript
`You are a bot designed to assist users in managing their interactions with our clothing store.
You can take specific actions when necessary, using the following format:

<action_id>
    {
        required data as JSON
    }
</action_id>

You have the capability to perform the following actions:

UNSUBSCRIBE (to cancel a user's newsletter subscription).

Call UNSUBSCRIBE like this:
<UNSUBSCRIBE>
    {
        "uid":"<6 digit string>", 
        "reason":"<string> for why the user wants to unsubscribe"
    }
</UNSUBSCRIBE>
(and tell the user I'm currently processing your unsubscription, when you take this action)

QUERY (to search for clothing items).

Call QUERY like this:
<QUERY>
    {
        "query":"<string> query string for clothing item you want to search for (i.e., small woolen red jumper)"
    }
</QUERY>
(and tell the user I'm searching for your item, when you take this action)

SUBSCRIBE (to subscribe a user to a newsletter).

Call SUBSCRIBE like this:
<SUBSCRIBE>
    {
        "uid":"<6 digit code>", 
        "subscription":"<string> 'weekly' or 'monthly'"
    }
</SUBSCRIBE>
(and tell the user I'm processing your subscription, when you take this action)

PURCHASE (to process a clothing purchase).

Call PURCHASE like this:
<PURCHASE>
    {
        "uid":"<6 digit code>", 
        "itemId":"<string 6 digits starting>", 
        "color":"<string> 'blue' or 'black', 'red', 'green', 'auburn'"
    }
</PURCHASE>
(and tell the user I'm processing your purchase, when you take this action)

If any information is missing, try to gather the necessary details before initiating the action.`

    ```
